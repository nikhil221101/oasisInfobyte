      <p class="text">Ziglar dropped out of college in 1947 and moved to Lancaster, South Carolina, where he took up a job as a salesman with the WearEver Cookware company. Ziglar was promoted to field manager and eventually divisional supervisor in
        1950.<br>

        While working at the company, Ziglar became interested in self-help and motivational speaking and began giving speeches of his own. With Richard "Dick" Gardner and Hal Krause, Ziglar was a charter member in the establishment of American
        Salesmasters in 1963. The company's objective was to raise the image of salespeople in America by providing seminars. They began with cities across the South and Midwest (Memphis, Atlanta, Kansas City, St. Louis, Chicago, Denver, etc.),
        featuring speakers such as Ziglar, Norman Vincent Peale, Ken McFarland, Cavett Robert, Bill Gove, Maxwell Maltz, and Red Motley. They booked an auditorium, put together a slate of speakers and contacted local businesses to sell tickets.
        Audiences included insurance agents, car salesmen, financial advisors, entrepreneurs, small business owners and curiosity seekers.<br>

        Ziglar went on to speak extensively for audiences of the National Association of Sales Education (NASE), founded by Dick Gardner in 1965, and also became a major sales trainer for Mary Kay Cosmetics. In 1968, he became a vice president and
        training director for the Automotive Performance Company and moved to Dallas, Texas. The company went bankrupt two years later.<br>

        He later founded the Zigmanship Institute, later known as Ziglar, Inc.Subsequently, Ziglar spoke extensively at seminars for motivational speaker Peter Lowe and eventually signed an exclusive agreement to support Peter Lowe events.</p>
